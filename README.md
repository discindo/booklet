This repository is home to a small guide for best practices in reproducible data analysis using the `R` programming language. The text is written in Macedonian.

The guide is written in `Rmarkdown` using `bookdown` and hosted on [gh-pages](https://discindo.github.io/booklet/). 

The guide was funded by a Civica grant as part of a open data project implemented by the NGO [Sloboden softver Makedonija](https://github.com/SlobodenSoftver). 

Usual disclaimers apply. For more see the text in Macedoninan in the [guide](https://discindo.github.io/booklet/intro.html#%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%98-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA).

Known issues: 

- The book currently does not render to PDF due to a bibliography error  
- Even when it did render to PDF, Cyrillic text was not not rendered  

We have no plans to pursue these PDF-related issues unless someone finds a PDF to be really necessary. Get in [touch](https://github.com/discindo/booklet/discussions) if this is the case.
